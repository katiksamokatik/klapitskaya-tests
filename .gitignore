#A gitignore file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
#During development inside the project can appear files, that shouldn't be tracked by git, because they are generated automatically by different reasons e.g. code editor, node, frameworks, etc. Thet are not affecting the code, but they are updating constantly, which forces you manually skip them during commit, so it can be easily skipped by adding them to .gitigore.
